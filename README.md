# Transcendance

This project is about making a **webserver from scrath** using **Docker** and use it to host a Pong-game-based website, on wich users can connect in a secured way, retrieve their informations, match history, stats as well as adding friends etc...

We decided to make the game run server-side, using **Django** for the backend, **PostgreSQL** for the database, and vanilla **Javascript** for the frontend.

I worked mainly on the game, using Django views, models and channels for the websockets/customers features to communicate between the backend in Python and the frontend in JS, in real time.
I also did a 3D version of the game using three.js.

*I worked on an AI being able to play the game, I coded the AI using Pytorch and trained it with the OpenAI Gym library, the goal was to save the weights at different trainging progress to have multiple difficulty levels.
We decided not to implement the AI as it wasn't fully working properly, but it was fun using Pytorch for the first time, coding my own little artificial neural network and training it.*
